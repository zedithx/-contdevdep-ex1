I found that the containers share the same diskspace and time since last boot. This is because they are in the same container, hence they share the same diskspace
The time since last boot is also the same as service 1 is made to be dependent on service 2 in the docker compose, hence they will start and stop at the same time.
The rest is different as the two services sit in their own containers of different ip addresses. We only expose service 1 as a http-server on 8199 publicly, and service 2 on port 8080 is kept hidden publicly.
We do not map the exposed port to the overall docker compose port, such that, it is only exposed to the service 1 container for access. We can see in the docker-status.txt that the port has been forwarded in service 1 but
not service2.
