I utilised Chatgpt
I used Chatgpt as I felt that it could better help explain things in a better manner that is catered towards me.
While I balanced usage of online material to give me base templates of dockerfiles/docker-compose, I used gpt to explain how each line worked 
and whether a line was necessary. As I had not written a docker-compose before, it proved to be useful as it allowed me to adapt the docker-compose
from others and change it into my use containers
Some mistakes that chatgpt did was giving me the wrong code syntax or library, such as telling me to use django contrib's request import, which
was clearly wrong. However, generally, with good prior coding knowledge, it was easy to spot these mistakes and adapt all of Chatgpt answers. By
asking the right questions, ChatGPT provided me everything needed to do the assignment and also understand what I am even doing thoroughly
